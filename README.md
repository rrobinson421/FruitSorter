FruitSorter is an simple, unrefined API application using FruitVice and YelpAPI.

The application allows you to sort through a variety of nutritional options found in fruit,
then once the values are selected, the app will generate the corresponding fruits.
You can either go through each fruit sequentially, or shuffle the current fruit.
You can input a town and state, and nearby stores that have the fruit will be displayed.
[If an error is shown during the store selection, chooose a nearby city.]

In order to run the application:
1. Have at least 17.0.9 Java installed
2. Have an assigned JAVA_HOME variable
3. Launch the FruitSorterExecutable.bat found in the root directory
